## Fish Weight Measurement System with MQTT, NFC, Scale Sensor, and Linear Actuator

This project involves a **digital scale** designed for accurately measuring the weight of fish, integrated with advanced technologies such as **MQTT**, **NFC**, a **scale sensor**, and a **linear actuator**. The system is built to automate the process of weighing fish and trigger an action based on the measured weight.

### Key Features:

1. **Scale Sensor**: The system uses a **high-precision scale sensor** to measure the weight of fish placed on the scale. The sensor provides accurate readings, which are then processed to determine the exact weight of the fish.

2. **MQTT Protocol**: The system employs the **MQTT protocol** for efficient and real-time communication. The weight data is transmitted through MQTT to a central server or monitoring device, allowing for quick updates and interaction with the system.

3. **NFC (Near Field Communication)**: An **NFC reader** is integrated to allow for user identification and interaction. Users can scan an NFC-enabled card or device to authenticate their identity, which helps track the fish weights and manage data securely.

4. **Linear Actuator**: The **linear actuator** is used to automate the opening of a gate based on the weight measurement. For example, when the fish weight exceeds a certain threshold, the actuator can trigger the opening of a gate, allowing the fish to be transferred automatically or placed into a separate area.

### System Overview:

- **MQTT Broker**: The MQTT broker facilitates communication between devices in the system. Weight measurements and actuator commands are sent to the broker and then relayed to connected devices.
  
- **Scale Sensor**: This is the core component for measuring the weight of the fish. The sensor accurately detects the weight, which is transmitted to the central system for further processing.

- **NFC Reader**: NFC is used for user authentication, enabling secure access and interaction with the system. Each NFC card or device is associated with specific user data to personalize the system's behavior.

- **Linear Actuator**: The actuator is used to open a gate or door based on the weight of the fish. For instance, the actuator can be programmed to open the gate if the fish exceeds a certain weight, allowing for seamless automation in environments like fish farming, seafood processing, or commercial fisheries.

### Application Use Cases:

- **Automated Fish Weight Measurement**: This system provides an automated way to weigh fish, eliminating the need for manual weighing and ensuring accurate measurements. Itâ€™s perfect for environments where fish weight needs to be monitored regularly.

- **Smart Sorting and Processing**: Based on the weight data, the system can automatically trigger actions like opening a gate to transfer fish, enabling a more efficient and streamlined sorting or processing workflow.

- **User Authentication and Tracking**: The NFC system adds an extra layer of security and personalization, allowing users to log in to track their fish weight measurements and even access historical data.

- **Automation in Fish Farms**: The combination of the scale, actuator, and MQTT allows for automated operations in fish farms or seafood facilities, reducing the need for manual handling and increasing overall efficiency.
